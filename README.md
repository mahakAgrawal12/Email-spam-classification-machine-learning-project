# Email-spam-classification-machine-learning-project
Email Classification using different machine learning algorithms.

This project is of a similar nature. Udacity's course "Intro to Machine Learning" gives a step by step description of algorithms to used and their background.

We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company. Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.

The following algorithms will be used for the email classification:

Naive Bayes
SVM
Decision Trees

SVM accuracy is 95%
Naive Bayes acuuracy is 98%
Decision Tree is accuracy 68%
